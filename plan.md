### 1. Suggested Features (with Users in Mind)

Since this is a **prototype for demonstration**, and you're using **users** mainly to justify private functionality, here's a practical feature set:

#### Core Features
- `Map view`: Publicly show parking spots with live status (available/occupied).
- `Spot details`: Click on a pin to see real-time occupancy info.
- `User login`: OAuth or basic JWT-based auth.
- `Favorites`: Authenticated users can save favorite parking locations.
- `Reservation system (mock)`: Allow logged-in users to ‚Äúreserve‚Äù a spot for a limited time (simulate with a timer).
- `History`: Authenticated users can view their recent parking sessions.

#### Why These?
- **Public map** = accessible to all.
- **Favorites/reservations/history** = reasons to log in.
- Avoids overcomplication while providing user value and project scope.

### 2. Development Plan (Bullet Points)

#### üîß Backend First ‚Äì Core Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up **PostgreSQL on AWS RDS** (Free Tier), define schema (`ParkingSpots`, `Users`, `Reservations`, `Sessions`).
- [ ] Start with `.NET 8 Web API`:
  - CRUD for `ParkingSpots`.
  - Auth endpoints (register/login).
  - Endpoints for favorites & reservations (auth required).
- [ ] Add **SignalR Hub** to broadcast spot updates to frontend.
- [ ] Create a **BackgroundService** to consume MQTT messages (from sensors/mock) and update DB + broadcast via SignalR.

#### üì° IoT Simulation Layer
- [ ] Deploy **Mosquitto or EMQX in Docker**.
- [ ] Write a mock script (Node.js/Python) to simulate sensor data and publish to MQTT.
  - Topics like: `parking/spot/{id}/status`.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend MVP
- [ ] Scaffold with **Vite + React + TypeScript**.
- [ ] Add **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** for map display.
- [ ] Fetch initial parking data from API and plot pins.
- [ ] Subscribe to SignalR for live updates and re-render map markers.
- [ ] Add basic UI:
    - Login / Register modal
    - Spot detail panel
    - Favorites list (protected route)
    - Mock reservation flow

#### üß™ Testing & Demo
- [ ] Run MQTT mock script to change statuses dynamically.
- [ ] Test flow: public map ‚Üí login ‚Üí reserve spot ‚Üí see update.
- [ ] Record short demo video of:
    - Real-time spot updates.
    - Login/reserve/favorites flow.
